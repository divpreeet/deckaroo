## 10/5/2025 - setup pico and switches  

i was deciding on building a gameboy like handheld with a pi, but then i got too overwhelmed, and decided to tone things down a bit, so im making a diy stream deck! i setup the repo, and setup the schems, i've decided on using a pi pico, but i think its a bit too overkill (i just want to try an arduino board), also i setup the switches in a matrix, i do plan on adding a matrix display and rotary encoders!
